# InTandem-Assignment

## Introduction
This project is an iOS mobile application developed using SwiftUI, designed to provide users with a seamless experience for dropping pins on a map. Users can enter remarks for each pin, and the app fetches the corresponding address based on the pin's location. The application aims to combine ease of use with interactive features, allowing users to manage their pin locations effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface of the iOS application.
- **SwiftData**: For local persistent storage of pins, remarks, and addresses.
- **Geocoder API**: To fetch addresses from latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: Users can easily visualize locations on a user-friendly map interface.
- **Pin Drop**: Click anywhere on the map to drop a pin, with an immediate popup for entering optional remarks.
- **Address Retrieval**: Automatically fetches the address for each pin using the Geocoder API, enhancing user experience.
- **Saved Pins List**: View all saved pins in a sidebar, displaying remarks and addresses for easy reference.
- **Pin Navigation**: Users can click on any saved pin in the sidebar to navigate the map to that pinâ€™s location.
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes SwiftData for local storage, ensuring all pin data is retained across app sessions.
